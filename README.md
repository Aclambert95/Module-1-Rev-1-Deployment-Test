# Code Refactor Starter Code

Throughout this homework, I cleaned up the CSS style using the acronyms: DRY and KISS - don't repeat yourself and keep it simple stupid. 
I added semantic elements to the index.html file to that the structure was organized properly (or at lease hopefully close).
I created a plethora of comments above each of the CSS style sheet elements to give a description for someone who may want to study my code.
